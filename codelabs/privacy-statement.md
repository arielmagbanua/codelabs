# Codelabs Privacy Statement

<!-- ------------------------ -->
## Respecting Your Privacy
Duration: 2

At Codelabs, we understand the importance of online privacy. That is why we operate our service without collecting or storing any personal information about you, our users.

<!-- ------------------------ -->
## Focus on Content, Not Data
Duration: 2

We believe you should be in control of your data. This means we do not track your browsing history, search queries, or any other activity that could be used to identify you.

<!-- ------------------------ -->
## How We Deliver Targeted Ads
Duration: 4

We partner with third-party advertising services that use non-personal information to deliver relevant ads. This information might include:

- **General Topics**: The general topic or category of the content you're viewing. For instance, you might be reading a sports article, and based on that, you might see ads for sports equipment.

- **Device Information**: Broad details about your device, such as its operating system and browser type (e.g., `Windows`, `Chrome`). This helps ensure ads display correctly.

- **Contextual Targeting**: The content itself. Ads may be matched to relevant keywords or themes within the content you're viewing.

<!-- ------------------------ -->
## Control Your Ad Experience (Where Applicable)
Duration: 2

Some of our advertising partners may offer options to manage or opt-out of interest-based advertising. These options are typically found directly within the ad itself.

<!-- ------------------------ -->
## Our Commitment to Transparency

We strive to be transparent about how we display ads. If you have any questions about our privacy practices or advertising partners, please don't hesitate to contact us using the information below.
